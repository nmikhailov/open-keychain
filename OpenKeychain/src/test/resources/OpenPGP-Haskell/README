Original README
===============

This is an OpenPGP library inspired by my work on OpenPGP libraries in
Ruby <https://github.com/singpolyma/openpgp>,
PHP <http://github.com/singpolyma/openpgp-php>,
and Python <https://github.com/singpolyma/OpenPGP-Python>.

It defines types to represent OpenPGP messages as a series of packets
and then defines instances of Data.Binary for each to facilitate
encoding/decoding.

For performing cryptography, see
<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/openpgp-crypto-api> or
<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/openpgp-Crypto>

For dealing with ASCII armor, see
<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/openpgp-asciiarmor>

It is intended that you use qualified imports with this library.

> import qualified Data.OpenPGP as OpenPGP
